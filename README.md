# List of open source UMLtools

Based on a search in GitHub. Dashboard created as part of the [BESSER project](https://github.com/besser-pearl)

See the [dashboard live](https://oss-uml-tools.streamlit.app/).

## Selection method
The selection method is based on the following inclusion criteria:
- Repositories that declare themselves as low-code projects
- Repositories with 50+ stars
- Active repositories (last commit not more than 1 year ago)
- Tools aimed at generating any software component (AI, dashboard, database or full applications)
and exclusion criteria
- Repositories with no information in English
- Repositories that were just created to host the source code of a published article
- Repositories that are awesome lists or collection of resources

The final list is the intersection of the above criteria manually curated to remove projects that use low-code in a different sense of what we mean by low-code in software development.
